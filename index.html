                Hello!  A little bit about myself.  I was born in Atlanta, Georgia.    
                Growing up as a military brat(My father served in the U.S. Coast Guard) I had the opportunity of moving to a few different places.  
                I lived in Virginia, South Florida and Rhode Island growing up. 
                I am the oldest of 3 boys with a 8 and 5 year gap between us.  
                I played organized football from the age of 6 all the way up to 18.<br>
                My position was mostly Defensive Back but I’ve also played Wide Receiver(which I highly disliked) and Linebacker.
                The inception of my interest in computers came from the LimeWire days. 
                Destroying my family’s desktop computer and going to Best Buy to have Geek Squad “fix” it.<br>  
                I enjoy making beats and I also game. RTSs, MMOs and city builders are my go to game types.  
                I’ve been in NYC since the fall of 2016 and I’m still in search for the best pizza joint here.  
                So if you have any suggestions hit me up in my contact page! 
            </p>
